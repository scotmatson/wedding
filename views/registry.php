        <p>The date has been set and we'd love you to come,<br>
           To celebrate our wedding, a long way for some,<br>
           All you must do, is decide what to wear<br>
           Then polish your jewellery and comb up your hair.</p>

        <p>Don't worry about gifts, don't buy us a yacht,<br>
           The things that we need, we've already got.<br>
           Our home is quite compact, we may have to move<br>
           Then our storage and space will surely improve.</p>

        <p>Don't go out shopping or get yourself stressed,<br>
           Don't alter your plans for a pre wedding rest.<br>
           If you want to be generous, despite what we've said,<br>
           Then save all the hassle and do this instead ...</p>

        <p>Don't know how to word this but will give it our best shot,<br>
           Contributions are most welcome, we'll go somewhere hot!<br>
           A honeymoon would be marvelous, to start off our life,<br>
           In our long winding journey, as new husband and wife!</p>

      <p>Buuuuut, for those that insist... check back often, we will try to have a registry up soon :)</p>
