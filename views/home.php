      <p>Hey guys! Feel free to poke around and update your R.S.V.P.; This site is still heavily under construction but it is functional! I'll try to have some additional information up as soon as I have a free moment but please if you need to know something now don't hesitate to contact Diana or myself personally. <a href="email:sjpmatson@gmail.com">sjpmatson@gmail.com</a></p>

      <p>I've developed and designed everything on this site myself and the code is hosted on GitHub if anyone feels ambitious and would like to help out. It is not built to look pretty on your phones and tablets though since school is taking up most of my time at the moment, so I encourage you to get on your PCs!</p>
